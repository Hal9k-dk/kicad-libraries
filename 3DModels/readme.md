#3D models

Put your 3D stuff here, preferably in a folder structure like so:

```
footprint_name/
|
|-readme.md (with description of footprint, source-files, and images from images/)
|
|-footprint_name.wrl
|-footprint_name.step
|
|-src/
| |
| |-source-files.format
|
|-images/
  |
  |-renders of footprint

```
